# StrategyMonitor

This project is a simulation of a strategy monitoring interface built with Qt.  
It mimics the behavior of a live trading monitor, displaying strategies and their corresponding orders in a visually clear and interactive way.  
**Note:** This is a standalone simulation â€” it does not connect to any real trading systems or data feeds.
